--- Day 3: Gear Ratios ---

The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)
game steps:
    1. read in the lines of inputs
    2. look identify locations of numbers
    3. Check if a symbol character (not periods: ".") is in one of the adjacent positions: up, down, left, right, diag up-left, diag up-right, diag down-right, diag down-left.
    4. If there is a symbol character adjacent to the located number then that number is added to a running sum
    5. Submit the final sum to the website.

Here is an example input:
467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.


--- Part Two ---
In the input the * symbol adjacent to exactly two numbers represents a gear. 
game steps:
    1. Locate a gear
    2  Find the product of the two numbers adjacent to the gear to get its gear ratio
    3. Sum all the gear ratios
    4. Submit answer to the website


Example:

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
There are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.

--- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
Part 1:

Play game with elf.  
Game set up: There is a bag with an unknown amount of red, green and blue cubes in it.
Game steps: 
1. Elf reaches in to the bag one or more times and grabs a handful of cubes. This represents a subset of the cubes in the bag and could be all the cubes.
2. Keep track of the number of cubes in each color
3. Steps one and two represent a single game, and several games are played, each game is labeled with a unique id number. 
4. The elf wants to know which games could have been played if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.
5. Sum the ids of the games that were identified in step 4 as possible and report the result to the website.

For example:

Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.

games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible. 
If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.



--- Part Two ---
Game Steps:
    1. Determine the minimum number of cubes that would need to be in the bag to make each game possible.
    3. Multiply the minimum number of each color together to determine the "power" of the given game.
    3. Sum the powers for each game
    4. Submit the sum of the powers to the website

the example:

Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green


In game 1, only 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes would be necessary to make it possible.
The power of game one is 48. The sum of all the powers for the 5 games above is 2286

# adventOfcode2023
The Advent of Code website can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2023/

The creator of the website is [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).  

The site is sponsored by several entities listed here: https://adventofcode.com/2023/sponsors . It is also crowd funded by some of its participants.  

Puzzles are released at the stroke of midnight on the east cost of the United States. Each puzzle has two parts, each of which are rewarded by a star.  The first part must be completed before the second part can be attempted.  There is a leader board, and it appears to award points to the first 100 people who finish a part of the puzzles.  I am not on the leader board, and do not attempt the problems until about mid-day.  

If you would like to offer constructive criticism of my solutions; I am willing to learn.  I have learned coding by taking on line courses that do not offer feedback on coding style and are only dependent on the task being completed successfully within the allotted time and memory consumption.
